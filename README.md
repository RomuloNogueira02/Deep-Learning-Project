# Things we'll have to do:

## Data Preprocessing:
* Resize images to fit the model (this might be tricky because the images have different sizes)
* Normalize pixel values?
* Data Augmentation
* Should we treat everything in one pot or separated? (all together makes more sense to me)

## Train the model
* Let's use the techniques the teacher taught us during the "Training DNNs" class
* Models used: 
    - Faster R_CNN
    - YOLO
    - DETR

## Evaluate
* Precision, recall and F1-Score
* Compare models performance

## Report
